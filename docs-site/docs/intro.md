# Welcome to Learn Anything

A personalised learning environment powered by Claude Code. Clone the template repo, tell the AI what you want to learn, and it generates a full curriculum — then teaches it to you interactively, concept by concept.

## Getting Started

1. Create your own copy from the [template repo](https://github.com/doyeongk/Learn-Anything-In-Claude) — click **Use this template** on GitHub, then clone your new repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Learn-Anything-In-Claude.git
   cd Learn-Anything-In-Claude
   ```
2. Open the project in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
3. Run `/project:init` and describe what you want to learn
4. The AI generates your personalised curriculum
5. Run `/project:start` to begin your first lesson

## How It Works

Your curriculum is structured using the **Diataxis framework** — four types of content that serve different learning needs:

- **Tutorials** — guided, hands-on learning experiences
- **How-to guides** — practical steps for specific tasks
- **Explanations** — understanding concepts and context
- **Reference** — lookup information and specifications

Progress is tracked automatically. Use `/project:progress` to check your status and `/project:review` for spaced repetition.
