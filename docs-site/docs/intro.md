# Welcome to Learn Anything

This is your personalised learning curriculum. Run `/project:init` in Claude Code to generate your curriculum, then `/project:start` to begin learning.

## Getting Started

1. Open this project in your terminal with Claude Code
2. Run `/project:init`
3. Describe what you want to learn
4. The AI will generate your personalised curriculum
5. Run `/project:start` to begin your first lesson

## How It Works

Your curriculum is structured using the **Diataxis framework** — four types of content that serve different learning needs:

- **Tutorials** — guided, hands-on learning experiences
- **How-to guides** — practical steps for specific tasks
- **Explanations** — understanding concepts and context
- **Reference** — lookup information and specifications

Progress is tracked automatically. Use `/project:progress` to check your status and `/project:review` for spaced repetition.
