# Exercise Workspace

This directory is the workspace for hands-on exercises during training. Files created here are gitignored (except this file).

## Conventions

- Each exercise creates its own subdirectory or file
- Exercise files are ephemeral — they exist for practice, not preservation
- The training delivery engine will instruct you on what to create here
- Clean up between exercises if the workspace gets cluttered
