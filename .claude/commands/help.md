LEARN ANYTHING IN CLAUDE — Command Reference
=============================================

CORE COMMANDS
─────────────
  /project:init          Generate a personalised curriculum.
                         Asks about your topic, level, and goals, then
                         researches the subject and creates all content.

  /project:start         Begin or resume training.
                         Picks up where you left off, or starts the next
                         module. Delivers lessons interactively with
                         checkpoints and exercises.

  /project:start X.Y     Jump to a specific module by ID (e.g. 1.3).

  /project:progress      Show completion status.
                         Displays per-section breakdown, completion
                         percentage, and flags modules due for review.

  /project:review        Spaced repetition review.
                         Tests retention on completed modules at 1-day,
                         7-day, and 30-day intervals with increasing
                         difficulty.

  /project:reset         Reset all progress to zero.
                         Preserves your curriculum and content. Only
                         clears completion status and review history.

  /project:add-content   Add a new module to your curriculum.
                         Scaffolds content, creates the command launcher,
                         and registers it in progress tracking.

  /project:help          Show this help text.

PER-MODULE COMMANDS
───────────────────
  /project:X-Y-slug      Jump directly to a specific module.
                         These are generated by /project:init. For example,
                         if you have a module "1.2 Variables and Types",
                         you can run /project:1-2-variables-and-types.

                         Run /project:progress to see all available module
                         IDs and their slugs.

HOW THE LEARNING SYSTEM WORKS
─────────────────────────────
  1. /project:init generates a curriculum tailored to your topic,
     experience level, and goals.

  2. Each module is classified by Diataxis type:
       - Tutorial    — guided, hands-on learning ("let's build X")
       - How-to      — task-oriented steps ("how to do X")
       - Explanation  — conceptual understanding ("why X works this way")
       - Reference   — lookup material ("X specification")

  3. /project:start delivers modules one concept at a time:
       - Short explanation with examples
       - Checkpoint question (you answer before continuing)
       - Adaptive pacing based on your responses
       - Session-close retrieval practice

  4. /project:review uses spaced repetition to strengthen retention:
       - 1-day review  — guided recall with cues
       - 7-day review  — prompted retrieval from memory
       - 30-day review — free recall, you teach the concept back

  5. Progress is tracked in progress.json and displayed with
     /project:progress.

  6. Your curriculum is also a browsable Docusaurus site in docs-site/.

TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE LEARNING
───────────────────────────
  - Do not skip checkpoint questions. Wrong answers help the AI adapt
    its teaching to your needs.

  - Do the exercises. Reading is not the same as doing. Use the Code/
    directory for hands-on work.

  - Use /project:review regularly. Spaced repetition is the most
    effective evidence-based retention technique.

  - If a module feels too easy, you can ask to skip ahead or increase
    the difficulty during the session.

  - If a module feels too hard, say so — the AI will slow down and
    provide more scaffolding.

  - Take breaks between modules. Spacing your learning across sessions
    improves long-term retention.

  - Run /project:progress periodically to see how far you have come
    and what reviews are due.
