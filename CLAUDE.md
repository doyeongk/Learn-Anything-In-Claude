# Learn Anything In Claude

## Project Overview

This is a personalised learning environment powered by Claude Code. Users clone this repo, run `/project:init`, describe what they want to learn, and the AI generates a full curriculum. They then run `/project:start` and learn interactively — concept by concept, with checkpoints, exercises, progress tracking, and spaced repetition review.

The same markdown files used during delivery are rendered as a browsable Docusaurus site.

## How Commands Work

Commands are in `.claude/commands/` and invoked as `/project:command-name`. They are markdown prompt templates that Claude Code follows as instructions. Commands reference skills by reading files from `.claude/skills/`.

## How Skills Work

Skills are reference documents in `.claude/skills/`. Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` entry point and optional `reference/` subdirectory. Commands load skills by reading these files. Skills are NOT standalone — they provide knowledge and procedures that commands orchestrate.

## Progress Tracking

`progress.json` tracks the user's state. It is created by `/project:init` and updated by the training delivery engine. Schema:

- `version`: always 1
- `user`: learner's name
- `topic`, `goal`, `skill_level`, `time_constraint`: set during init
- `modules`: keyed by module ID (e.g. "1.1"), each with `status`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `reviews[]`

Valid statuses: `not_started` → `in_progress` → `completed`

## Key Conventions

- Module IDs use `X.Y` format (section.module)
- Module files use `X.Y-slug.md` naming in `docs-site/docs/`
- Section directories use `NN-` numeric prefixes for sidebar ordering
- Diataxis types: tutorial, how-to, explanation, reference
- All timestamps are ISO 8601
- The `Code/` directory is the exercise workspace — exercises run here
- Never modify `progress.template.json` — it is the clean schema

## Tool Usage

When executing commands, use Claude Code tools:

- `AskUserQuestion` — gather user input (topic, level, preferences)
- `Task` with subagents — parallel research, parallel file generation
- `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` — file operations
- `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` — research during /init
- `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList` — track multi-step operations
- `Glob`/`Grep` — find files and content

## Content Generation

When generating module content during `/project:init`:

1. Read the appropriate diataxis template from `docs-site/docs/_*-template.md`
2. Read the diataxis skill for writing guidelines
3. Generate substantive content — not stubs or placeholders
4. Each module should have enough content for 15–30 minutes of guided learning
5. Include knowledge checks, examples, and exercises appropriate to the diataxis type
